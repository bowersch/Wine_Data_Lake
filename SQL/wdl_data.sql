The area receives just 6 to 8 inches of annual rainfall, making supplemental irrigation a necessity throughout the AVA.',

With an area of only 5.9 square miles, The Rocks District is the second smallest AVA in Oregon. The Rocks District is wholly contained within both Walla Walla Valley and Columbia Valley AVAs.',

        'The Rocks District receives an insufficient average of 15 inches of annual precipitation, so vines are irrigated with water from the Walla Walla River fed by the Blue Mountains'' snowmelt. Growing season is mostly sunny with low humidity, so major daily temperature variations are common. During summers, the region often experiences five to 10 days with temperatures exceeding 100°F.',

This temperature variation allows the grapes to develop their flavor and complexity while retaining their natural acidity. The appellation lies east of the Cascade Mountain Range, which limits the amount of rainfall to an annual 12.5 inches, allowing vintners to perfectly manage the plants through irrigation.',

        'Applegate Valley is surrounded by the Siskiyou Mountains, which were created by upthrusts of the ocean floor as a plate forced its way under the continental shelf. The Siskiyou National Forest borders the Applegate Valley to the west, and the Rogue River National Forest to the east. Vineyards are typically grown at higher elevations up to 2,000 feet.'),
        
		('Snake River Valley',
        'The Snake River Valley AVA spans southwest Idaho and significant parts of Baker and Malheur counties in Eastern Oregon. The area is a massive 8,263 square miles. Its boundaries make up the now dry, 4 million-year-old Lake Idaho, which extends 149 miles northwest to southeast, from the Oregon-Idaho state line to just west of Twin Falls, Idaho. The major Oregon cities include Ontario and Baker City.',

        'Located inland, and in the rain shadows of the Cascade, Sierra Nevada and Owyhee mountain ranges, the Snake River Valley receives just 10 to 12 inches of annual rainfall, most of which occurs in winter. This allows vintners to perfectly manage the plants through irrigation during the region''s relatively short (142 days on average) growing season. This area is also characterized by hot days and cool nights in summer. This drastic diurnal temperature variation helps balance natural acids and sugars, making the grapes ideal for premium winemaking.',
        'There is a great variety of soil types in the Snake River Valley, predominantly sand, mud silts, loess and volcanic detritus on top of sedimentary rock. The soil types of the Snake River Valley are so diverse that soil is not a distinguishing factor in this appellation.',
        'Snake River Valley encompasses the now dry Lake Idaho. With elevation between 2,165 and 3,412 feet, this basin area appears sunken compared to the surrounding mountains, which exceed 7,000 feet. Multiple mountain ranges provide a barrier from Pacific Northwest marine influences. Vineyard elevations go as high as 3,000 feet higher than any other winegrowing regions in the Northwest; though, most of the vineyards in Snake River Valley are at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 feet.'),

        
		('Southern Oregon',
        'The Southern Oregon AVA exists in the southwest portion of the state, stretching 125 miles from south of Eugene to the California border, and 60 miles at its widest between the Cascade Mountain Range to the east and the Coast Range to the west. It encompasses Umpqua Valley, Rogue Valley, Red Hill Douglas County and Applegate Valley AVAs.',
        'While this region provides the warmest growing conditions in Oregon, there exist cool microclimates within its varied hillsides and valleys that enable Southern Oregon to successfully grow both cool- and warm-climate varietals. This area receives significantly less rainfall than other viticultural areas in Oregon (40 percent less than in the Willamette Valley) and is generally a warm, sunny, arid climate.',

        'Southern Oregon''s soils are varied and complex, though generally derived from bedrock, specifically from the 200 million year old Klamath Mountains, which are comprised of sedimentary rocks, to the west.',
        'The Southern Oregon AVA contains varied, mountainous features with vineyards typically situated in high mountain valleys at elevations between 1,000 to 2,000 feet. The lofty southern coastal mountains provide a barrier to the west, blocking marine air and casting a rain shadow to the area''s south and east.'),
        
		('Umpqua Valley',
        'Umpqua Valley sits between the Coast Range to the west and the Cascades to the east, with the Willamette Valley to the north and the Rogue Valley, south. Named for the legendary fishing river that runs nearby, the appellation stretches 65 miles from north to south, and is 25 miles from east to west.',
        'The Umpqua Valley can successfully grow both cool and warm varieties. It''s comprised of three distinct climatic sub-zones: 1) The northern area around the town of Elkton enjoys a cool, marine-influenced climate. It receives around 50 inches of annual rainfall, making irrigation unnecessary. Pinot Noir and other cool-climate varieties thrive here. 2) The central area to the northwest of Roseburg has an intermediate climate where both cool and warm varieties do well. 3) The area south of Roseburg is warmer and more arid, similar to Rogue and Applegate valleys to the south, making irrigation a necessity. Warm-climate varieties, including Tempranillo, Syrah and Merlot flourish here.',

        'Umpqua Valley soils are as varied as the climate. Generally, they are derived from a mix of metamorphic, sedimentary and volcanic rock; though more than 150 soil types have been identified in the region. The valley floor levels have mostly deep alluvial or heavy clay materials, while the hillsides and bench locations have mixed alluvial, silt or clay structures — all excellent for winegrowing.',
        'The complex topography of the Umpqua Valley is a result of the collision of three mountain ranges of varying age and structure: Klamath Mountains, Coast Range and Cascades. Many say the area should not be thought of as a single valley, but, rather, more accurately the “Hundred Valleys of the Umpqua” because it is made up of a series of interconnecting small mountain ranges.'),
        
		('Elkton Oregon',
        'Located in Douglas County, the AVA is 33 miles from the Pacific Ocean, with the Cascade Range to the east, Willamette Valley to the north and Rogue Valley to the south. A part of the Umpqua Valley AVA, it is named for the town of Elkton and claims the northernmost and lowest elevation region in the Umpqua.',
        'Elkton Oregon is the coolest and wettest region within the larger Umpqua Valley and produces different varieties and different wine styles than the rest of the larger AVA. Elkton enjoys a cool, marine-influenced climate with a longer growing season than the rest of the Umpqua. The region receives about 50 inches of rain each year.',
        'The AVA is dominated by the coastal mountain geology, lying over a combination of sedimentary, volcanic and metamorphic rock from the middle Eocene. More than 50 different soil series or complexes are present, made up of mostly residual clay and/or silt loam soil or cobble-rich alluvial deposits from the Yamhill and Tyee formation, and the Umpqua River terrace.',

        'Elkton Oregon contains a wide range of terrain dissected by the broader meanders of the Umpqua River. The majority of the AVA falls below the 1,000-foot contour and includes the river bottom land elevation 130 to 160 feet as well as river terraces and foothills near the river also 130 to 160 feet.'),
        
		('Red Hill Douglas County',
        'Red Hill Douglas County is a sub-appellation of the Umpqua Valley near the small town of Yoncalla, which lies about 30 miles north of Roseburg and parallels Interstate 5. It encompasses 5,500 acres and is a single-vineyard AVA one of just a few in the country with Red Hill Vineyard planted to 220 acres of vines.',
        'Red Hill Douglas County has a relatively mild climate, with daytime averages of 75�F during growing season (as opposed to regions farther south that can experience highs of 105�F). The marine influence reaching this area also provides a wetter climate than the surrounding Umpqua Valley area. Thanks to its higher elevation, the area generally enjoys a frost-free growing season.',

        'Red Hill Douglas County is dominated by iron-rich, red volcanic Jory soils, which were formed from ancient volcanic basalt and consist of silt, clay and loam soils. They are mostly deep and well drained to the 15-foot depth.',
        'Elevation in this area ranges from the 800-foot contour line to 1,200 feet, the maximum elevation for quality grape production. Geologically, Red Hill is part of the Umpqua Formation, which is composed of basalts similar to the volcanic rocks on the Pacific Ocean floor. It has many rising domes that give it an undulating appearance.'),
        
		('Willamette Valley',
        'The biggest Oregon AVA at 5,200 square miles, the Willamette Valley encompasses the drainage basin of the Willamette River. It runs from the Columbia River in Portland, south through Salem, to the Calapooya Mountains near Eugene. The Coast Range marks its west boundary and the Cascade Mountains mark the east.',

        'Overall, the climate is mild. Winters are typically cool and wet; summers are dry and warm. Heat above 90�F only occurs 5 to 15 days per year, and the temperature drops below 0�F once every 25 years. Most rainfall occurs in the late autumn winter, and early spring, when temperatures are the coldest. The valley gets relatively little snow, 5 to 10 inches per year. This temperate climate, combined with coastal marine influences, make growing conditions ideal for cool-climate grapes, including Pinot Noir. The Willamette Valley''s warm days and cool nights during the growing season allow the fruit to develop flavor and complexity while retaining their natural acidity.',
        'The Willamette Valley is an old volcanic and sedimentary seabed that has been overlaid with gravel, silt, rock and boulders brought by the Missoula Floods from Montana and Washington between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago. The most common of the volcanic type is red Jory soil, which is found above 300 feet (as it had escaped the Missoula Floods deposits) and is between four and six feet deep; it provides excellent drainage for wine grapes. Anything below 300 is primarily sedimentary-based soil.',
        'The Willamette Valley is protected by the Coast Range to the west, the Cascades to the east and a series of hills to the north. The largest concentration of vineyards are located to the west of the Willamette River, on the leeward slopes of the Coast Range, or among the valleys created by the river''s tributaries. Most of the region''s vineyards reside a few hundred feet above sea level, with some exceptions.'),
        
		('Chehalem Mountains',
        'Encompassing over 100 square miles, the AVA touches three counties (Yamhill, Washington and Clackamas) and yet is only 19 miles from the heart of Portland and 45 miles east of the Pacific Ocean.',
        'Chehalem Mountains'' elevation goes from 200 to 1,633 feet, resulting in varied annual precipitation (37 inches at the lowest point and 60 inches at the highest) as well as the greatest variation in temperature within the Willamette Valley. These variations can result in three-week differences in the ripening of Pinot Noir.',

        'The Chehalem Mountains reflect millions of years of soil accumulation, creating a rich geological experiment in one tightly packed geographical area. Within this one region there are ancient, uplifted sedimentary seabeds, weathered rich red soils from lava flows down the Columbia River and relatively new glacial sediment scoured from western states and blown onto north-facing hillsides from windstorms.',
        'Chehalem Mountains is a single landmass made up of hilltops, ridges and spurs uplifted from the Willamette Valley floor. The appellation includes all land in the area above the 200-foot elevation. They are the highest mountains in the Willamette Valley with their tallest point, Bald Peak, at 1,633 feet.'),

        'Dundee Hills can be found 28 miles southwest of Portland and 40 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean. It is situated within an irregular circle of about 6,490 acres.',

        'The Dundee Hills AVA is protected from severe climatic variations by surrounding geographic features. The Coast Range to the west helps weaken effects of the Pacific''s heavy rainfall and windstorms, and casts a rain shadow over the area, resulting in only 30 to 45 inches of annual precipitation, most of which falls outside of the growing season in the winter. Slope and elevation benefit vineyards with warmer nights and less frost and fog than nearby valley floors.',
        'Dundee Hills is known for its rich, red volcanic Jory soils, which were formed from ancient volcanic basalt and consist of silt, clay and loam soils. They typically reach a depth of 4 to 6 feet and provide excellent drainage for superior quality wine grapes.',
        'The Dundee Hills consists of a single, continuous landmass that rises above the surrounding Willamette Valley floors and is defined by the 200-foot contour line to the AVA''s highest peak of 1,067 feet. The area comprises a north-south spine with ridges with small valleys on its east, south and west sides. Dundee Hills is part of a hill chain that developed as a result of volcanic activity and the collision of the Pacific and North American plates.'),
        
		('Eola-Amity Hills',

        'The region enjoys a temperate climate of warm summers and mild winters, and 40 inches of annual rain, most of which falls outside of the growing season. The climate in this region is greatly influenced by its position due east of the Van Duzer Corridor, which provides a break in the Coast Range that allows cool Pacific Ocean air to flow through. This drops temperatures in the region dramatically, especially during late summer afternoons, helping to keep grape acids firm.',
        'The soils mainly contain volcanic basalt from ancient lava flows as well as marine sedimentary rocks and alluvial deposits at the lower elevations. This combination results in a relatively shallow, rocky set of well-drained soils that produce fruit with great concentration.',
        'Eola Hills, and its northern extension, Amity Hills, is part of a North Willamette Valley hill chain that developed out of intense volcanic activity and the collision of the Pacific and North American plates.

As a result, the primarily east- and south-facing vineyards receive less rainfall (just 33 inches annually, as compared to 40 inches in Eola-Amity Hills) than sites only 12 miles to the east. The foothills also provide protection from cold wind occurring in the spring and fall. Winegrowers also have the option of planting vineyards on more southerly facing sites to take advantage of the drying winds from the Van Duzer corridor, which helps control mold and mildew during Oregon''s humid summer days.',
        'The soils are the oldest and most complex of any Oregon AVA, primarily consisting of uplifted marine sedimentary loam and silt with alluvial overlays; beneath is a base of uplifting basalt. Clay and silt loam averages 20 to 40 inches in depth - the range in which the AVA''s terroir is best achieved - before reaching harder rock and compressed sediments shot with basalt pebbles and stone.',
        'McMinnville''s elevation levels range from 200 to 1,000 feet, and the area encompasses the east and southeast slopes of the Coast Range foothills. Geologically, the most distinctive feature in this area is the Nestucca Formation, a 2,000-foot-thick bedrock formation that extends west of the city of McMinnville to the slopes of the Coast Range.'),
