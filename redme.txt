Server setup:
    When inside /server/ directory, run "npm install" to install required packages locally
    Server only boots a demo page currently
Running server:
    1. run "npm start" to boot up the server locally -- if ran this way server will need to be rebooted
        for code changes to be visible
    2. run "npm test" to boot server continuously using nodemon -- in this case the server will
        automatically be rebooted after code changes are detected
